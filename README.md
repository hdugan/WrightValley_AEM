Figure 1. a) AEM flight lines over the North Fork of Wright Valley and Lake Vanda (Line 1), over Don Juan Pond (Line 2), and Lake Vanda towards the South Fork (Line 2). White circles show the location of the DVDP boreholes. b-d) Resistivity profiles of the three flight lines. The black line represents the sediment/water interface (bathymetry) of the Lake Vanda basin. Lower data are shaded beyond the depth of investigation. Black vertical rectangles show the approximate location and depth of the DVDP boreholes crossed by Line 1 and 3.
